# Make React Fast Again Part 1: Reconciliation and Component Design

## React can be fast

It's a shame that there is no style guide for React. One of the biggest mistakes that is made, almost without fail, is poor performance. The core architecture of many apps inevitably out-scale themselves. React apps start fine, but slowly accumulate performance problems. But there is nothing inherently wrong with React. Poor architectural decisions that make React slow.

Good architecture can be learned. But it requires a deep understanding of React, data structure mutations, and applying tried-and-true design patterns to component design. The first step is to learn what the [virtual DOM](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) is and the [reconciliation algorithm](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).

## The Virtual DOM

The virtual DOM is Reactâ€™s approach to high-performance DOM changes. The virtual DOM is an un-rendered representation of the previous DOM state. When a change occurs, optimal transformation strategies are performed by comparing the virtual DOM to the DOMs next incoming state.

The comparison process utilizes the reconciliation algorithm. The DOM diffing process of a mounted component is commonly referred to as a rerender. When a component rerenders, its child components (at all levels of nesting) also trigger render cycles. Render cycles are triggered when React-managed data is updated (usually with the [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) hook).

This rendering strategy can create crippling performance issues in large applications. Rerender propagation is an obfuscated process for the untrained eye. When, why, and where rerenders are is lost in the sauce for large applications.

Rerenders are not inherently bad. After all, they are necessary for an application to be responsive. It is when rerenders occur many times and, most importantly, when they are triggered in unnecessary places.

## Leveraging React Developer Tools

Discovering performance woes is easy (fixing them is another story) with the browser extension [React Developer Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?pli=1). It has a performance profiler that visualizes component render cycles, via flame graph.

To visualize this, a small application is needed. This app has a button that increments a counter and a basic table implementation. Note that this table, on a conceptual level, is unrelated to the button and its incrementing UI.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const App = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter((prev) => prev + 1)}>
        increment ({counter})
      </button>
      <Table />
    </div>
  );
};

const Table = () => (
  <table>
    <tbody>
      {Array(5)
        .fill(null)
        .map((_, i) => (
          <Row idx={i} key={i} />
        ))}
    </tbody>
  </table>
);

const Row = ({ idx }) => (
  <tr>
    <td>{idx}</td>
  </tr>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  // assuming you have an html file with a <div id="root" />
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

A button click triggers a render cycle by invoking `setCounter`. Visually, `App` has experienced a DOM update. But reconciliation is diffing more DOM nodes than one might expect.

No `props` are passed down to `Table` and `Row`. It is fundamentally impossible for these components be affected by `App`'s state change. But cascading rerenders to child components is the default behavior. Updating `App` causes reconciliation to trigger in unnecessary locations. This consumes precious resources on the client.

![uncontrolled cascading rerenders](../images/no-memo-rerender.png)

Imagine one state change triggering useless render cycles on hundreds DOM elements. What if something trivial like an `input` did this on every keystroke? This is the silent killer of enterprise software.

There is a de facto solution exists for useless rerender suppression: `React.memo`. It performs a shallow equality check (JavaScript's strict equality operator) on all incoming `props` from the parent component. In the sample code, simply wrapping the child components with it suppresses the useless rerenders.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const App = () => {
  // ...
};

const Table = React.memo(() => (
  // ...
));

const Row = React.memo(({ idx }) => (
  // ...
));

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  // assuming you have an html file with a <div id="root" />
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The flame graph has changed. There are now gray cells. These represent components that did not rerender during a particular render cycle in the app.

![memoed to prevent cascading rerenders](../images/memoed-supressed-rerender.png)

It would be naive to think that we're done. Any professional developer knows that this example looks nothing like enterprise software. We need to develop a full-scale architecture in order to leverage the power of `React.memo` in apps that render thousands of DOM nodes and trigger hundreds of heavy render cycles (possibly thousands) per minute.

## Check out the demo

Seeing is believing. The rest of the article will refer to an basic app. It can be run in a local environment, which can be cloned from this [repo](https://github.com/andrew1007/mrfa-demo/tree/main) (type definitions included).

## God components are slow

In order to see what a fast implementation looks like, first we need to look at one that is slow.

Here is the god component of a searchable, filterable, and selectable table using local state. The current data management system forces the god component to manage all data and event handlers. Data needs to be repeatedly passed down from the top of the component hierarchy.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Filter from "./Filter";
import Table from "./Table";
import { fetchColumns, fetchFilters, fetchRows } from "../resources/requests";

const App = () => {
  const [rows, setRows] = useState([]);
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState([]);
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState([]);
  const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");
  const [focusedFilter, setFocusedFilter] = useState("");
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState([]);

  // load data from mock api on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    Promise.all([fetchRows(), fetchFilters(), fetchColumns()]).then(
      ([rows, filters, columns]) => {
        setRows(rows);
        setColumns(columns);
        setFilters(filters);
      }
    );
  }, []);

  // compute which rows match the current search + filter criteria
  const getFilteredRows = () => {
    const currentFilter = filters.find(({ id }) => id === focusedFilter);
    if (!currentFilter && !searchText) {
      return rows;
    }

    return rows
      .filter((row) =>
        currentFilter?.conditions.every(
          (cond) => row[cond.key] === cond.value
        ) ?? true
      )
      .filter(({ name }) => name.includes(searchText));
  };

  // update text in cell
  const handleCellEdit = ({ id, key, value }) => {
    setRows((prevRows) => {
      return prevRows.map((row) => {
        if (row.id === id) {
          return { ...row, [key]: value };
        }
        return row;
      });
    });
  };

  // toggle a row checkbox
  const toggleCheckChange = (id) => (e) => {
    if (e.target.checked) {
      return setSelected((prevSelected) => [...prevSelected, id]);
    } else {
      return setSelected((prevSelected) =>
        prevSelected.filter((selectedId) => selectedId !== id)
      );
    }
  };

  // toggle checkbox that selects/deselects all
  const toggleCheckAll = () => {
    if (selected.length === rows.length) {
      setSelected([]);
    } else {
      setSelected(rows.map(({ id }) => id));
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Filter
        options={filters}
        onFilterChange={setFocusedFilter}
        onSearchChange={setSearchText}
        searchText={searchText}
      />
      <Table
        rows={getFilteredRows()}
        columns={columns}
        selected={selected}
        onEditCell={handleCellEdit}
        onCheck={toggleCheckChange}
        onAllCheck={toggleCheckAll}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

Inspecting the flame graph reveals useless rerenders. On checkbox select and selecting new filter conditions, a rerender of the entire table occurs. When inspecting the props that are passed from `App` down to `Table`, it is fundamentally impossible to ever suppress rerenders; even if `Table` is wrapped in a `React.memo`. `getFilteredRows()`, `handleCellEdit`, `toggleCheckChange`, and `toggleCheckAll` fail reference equality on every render cycle.

![performance of click all checkbox using unoptimized app](../images/local-state-dev-tool.png)

Technically, `useCallback` and `useMemo` could be used to retain reference equality. But these should be avoided. They are brittle to use and must be vigilantly maintained. These hooks rely on a dependency array, which is susceptible to ineffective memoization and/or stale values. Liberal use of them inevitably become liabilities in large applications. All of these issues and considerations are a non-issue if a different data management design pattern is used. It starts by managing data outside of the component hierarchy: the Context API.

## Performant Context

The guiding principle of fast components is the minimization of UI relying on other UI for data. Optimizing becomes harder when more data is passed from parent to child. Circumventing data-passing from parent to child requires the context API.

Context is widely regarded as slow; with claims that it does not scale. This is a half-truth. Context is not intrinsically slow. What is slow is the downstream consequence of its usage in a React component. [`useContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) triggers a rerender every context data updates. In reality, the perception of context "being slow" is a commentary on the slowness of the reconciliation algorithm.

This performance critique is based on the most common design pattern, which is calling `useContext` directly inside the UI component that needs the data. The key phrase is "UI component". Of course, `useContext` must be called in a component. But `useContext` can be called in a component that has no HTML in it.

Here is a basic state management library that can be used to suppress rerenders. It is a scalable implementation that works in applications of any size. It leverages the following concepts:

- [`Context`](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) to store data.
- [`useReducer`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) to dispatch and transform state data.
- Higher order component to access context data and process data before it is passed to a component.

```jsx
import React, {
  createContext,
  useContext,
  useReducer,
} from "react";

const noop = () => null;

const makeProvider = (initialState) => {

  const StateContext = createContext(initialState);
  const DispatchContext = createContext(noop);

  const reducer = (state, action) => ({
    ...state,
    ...action(state),
  });

  // Provider component with state management hook
  const Provider = ({ children }) => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    return (
      <DispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        <StateContext.Provider value={state}>
          {children}
        </StateContext.Provider>
      </DispatchContext.Provider>
    );
  };

  // HOC to connect state to components
  const applyState = (mappedState) =>{
    return (Component) => {
      const MemoComponent = memo(Component);
      const ApplyStateComponent = (props) => {
        const mappedStateInstance = useMemo(() => mappedState?.(), []);

        const state = useContext(StateContext);
        const combinedProps = {
          ...props,
          ...mappedStateInstance?.(state, props),
        };

        return <MemoComponent {...combinedProps} />;
      };
      ApplyStateComponent.displayName = `applyState{${Component.name}}`;
      return ApplyStateComponent;
    };
  }

  const useDispatch = () => useContext(DispatchContext);

  return {
    applyState,
    Provider,
    useDispatch,
  };
}

export default makeProvider;
```

The high order component `applyState` is the secret sauce. `applyState` acts as a proxy for context access. Components never have direct access to context. `applyState` accepts a function resolver, allowing data processing before it is passed down to the component. Under the hood, `applyState` calls `useContext`. As a consequence, `applyState` always gets rerendered. But the computational overhead of algorithms in `applyState`'s function resolver is miniscule compared to rerenders of components with DOM nodes.

By strategically parsing and computing data inside `applyState`, `React.memo` (embedded in `applyState`) can properly detect and suppress useless rerenders. The interface of `applyState` is akin to [`connect`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect) in `redux`. The function resolver of `applyState` is essentially `mapStateToProps`.

The `dispatch` function (from `useReducer`) is in its own context and directly exposed (via `useDispatch`). `dispatch` is a stable dependency (retains reference equality), making it safe to use directly in components. The full state tree is available in the callback argument. This `dispatch` pattern is essentially a (less powerful) thunk that can be directly called in a component.

This is one step closer to applying this to enterprise software. But there is an art to maximizing strict equality for components that receive data from context.

## Optimized Component Design

With the prerequisite knowledge out of the way, component design can be explored. Designing optimized components is about creating a logical separation of UI elements based on the data they use. Component size is not the causation of optimized components; it is a correlation.

### Reference data using ids

Make no mistake: passing data down from parent to child is oftentimes required. However, making strategic decisions on what to pass down is the difference between the optimized and naive approach.

In a majority of cases, only `id` needs to be passed down from parent to child. The `id` can be used inside `applyState`'s function resolver to find the necessary data. This concept will be leveraged heavily. For simplicity's sake, the code snippet doesn't include the search/filtering algorithm.

```jsx
const TableRows = ({ rowIds }) => (
  <>
    {rowIds.map((id) => <TableRow id={id} key={id} />)}
  </>
);

const mappedState = () => (state) => ({
  rowIds: state.rowIds,
})

export default applyState(mappedState)(TableRows);
```

In the components that only receive `id`, `state` is accessed to get the relevant data.

```jsx
const TableRow = props => <div />

const mappedState = () => (state, ownProps) => ({
    value: state.rows[ownProps.id],
});

export default applyState(mappedState)(RowCell);
```

### Compute to primitives outside of UI

Primitive data types are easy to optimize because JavaScript's strict equality checks them by value. When possible, reduce data down to primitives outside of UI. In `RowCheckbox`, computing the `checked` status in `applyState` is an easy win. The `boolean` value only changes when that specific checkbox changes state. The array of selected checkboxes updates on state changes of any checkbox. If the array were passed to the component, every checkbox would rerender, regardless of whether or not its `checked` state has changed.

```jsx
const RowCheckbox = (props) => {
  const { checked } = props;

  // Don't worry about this handler. We're concentrating on the pre-computation aspect of this code snippet
  const toggleCheck = (e) => null

  return <input onChange={toggleCheck} type="checkbox" checked={checked} />;
};

const mappedState = () => (state, ownProps) => ({
  checked: state.selected.includes(ownProps.id),
});

export default applyState(mappedState)(RowCheckbox);
```

### Isolate un-optimizable UI

The rendered rows is dynamic because of searching and filtering. This requires the `rowIds` to be recomputed every render cycle, which guarantees strict equality failure. Based on our limited knowledge, this useless rerender is virtually unavoidable. In this situation, where optimization is not possible, isolate this algorithm from the rest of the system. Be mindful of this component's children `props` to minimize propagating render cycles.

```jsx
const TableRows = ({ rowIds }) => (
  <>
    {rowIds.map((id) => <TableRow id={id} key={id} />)}
  </>
);

const getFilteredRowIds = (state) => {
  const { filters, focusedFilter, rows } = state
  const { conditions } = filters.find(({ id }) => id === focusedFilter);

  return rows
    .filter(
      (row) =>conditions.every((cond) => row[cond.key] === cond.value)
    )
    .map(({ id }) => id)
};

const mappedState = () => (state) => ({
  rowIds: getFilteredRowIds(state),
});

export default applyState(mappedState)(TableRows);
```

This design allows unoptimized operations to have virtually no performance-related consequences. The flame graph shows a miniscule 0.7ms render speed.

![performance of click all checkbox using unoptimized app](../images/table-rows-rerender-overhead.png)

### Isolate zero-dependency and static UI

UI that do not accept nor provide `props` never have a reason to rerender after initial mount. In this case a subset of the `table` HTML are static and never need to be diffed for changes. The React components (`AllCheckbox`, `TableColumns`, `TableRows`) have no parent `props`. `Table` will never be a source of rerenders for them. All these can be grouped together into one component. Remember to wrap these types of components in `React.memo`.

```jsx
const Table = () => {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <AllCheckbox />
          </td>
          <TableColumns />
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <TableRows />
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};

export default React.memo(Table);
```

### Tightly scope event handlers and data

In most cases, it is better to have data close to the UI that use it. `RowCell` is a good case study for how this can be done. In most cases, it is better to create event handlers in the locations where they are used. It is also better to extract data from state where it is used. In most cases, only the `id` should be necessary for this. But in the case of individual cells, the name of the column is also required. The `TableRow` needs to pass down the column name. In order to do this, `TableRow` needs to know what `columns` to render.

```jsx
const TableRow = ({ columns, id } ) => (
  <tr>
    <td><RowCheckbox id={id} /></td>
    {columns.map(({ key }) => <RowCell key={key} field={key} id={id} />)}
  </tr>
);

const mappedState = () => (state) => ({
  columns: state.columns,
});

export default applyState(mappedState)(TableRow);
```

With the necessary identifiers to get the current data value, the data to render can now be computed inside `applyState`'s function resolver. In this use case, the value is a string, which will suppress useless rerenders.

```jsx
const RowCell = (props) => {
  const { value, id, field } = props;
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleEdit = (value) => {
    dispatch((prevState) => {
      const nextRows = { ...prevState.rows };
      nextRows[id] = {
        ...nextRows[id],
        [field]: value,
      };

      return {
        rows: nextRows,
      };
    });
  };

  return (
    <EditableCell value={value} onConfirm={handleEdit} />
  );
};

const mappedState = () => (state, ownProps) => {
  const { rows } = state;
  const { field, id } = ownProps;
  return {
    value: rows[id][field],
  };
};

export default applyState(mappedState)(RowCell);
```

## Performance scaling

The rerender overhead of typical architectures scale linearly. If rerenders are not suppressed, twice the amount of HTML means twice the number of nodes that the reconciliation algorithm needs to diff. This problem is compounded when algorithms are constantly recomputed on rerenders. But this is a non-issue when useless rerender suppression strategies are utilized. In many cases, complexity increases have no impact on responsiveness.

This can be seen by comparing the performance as the table grows algorithmic complexity. As the resource requirements grows, the god component's responsiveness scales into the stratosphere. The optimized app, on the other hand, is resistant to scaling issues.

Here is a comparison for ticking the table's "All" checkbox. With the unoptimized app, render time is 32.6 ms.
![performance of click all checkbox using unoptimized app](../images/local-state-all-checkbox.png)

In the optimized app, it is a render speed of 16.7 ms. A substantial improvement.
![performance of click all checkbox using optimized app](../images/optimized-all-checkbox.png)

To see how it truly scales, we can insert an algorithm to artificially slow down the app. The following function will be run in every cell on each render cycle.

```javascript
const heavy = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    JSON.stringify({});
  }
};
```

Here are how the render cycle speed changes, as the number of iterations increases. Any responsiveness slower than 50 ms is typically considered to be intrusive to the user experience. The unoptimized app almost immediately hurts the user experience.

|Iterations | Optimized (ms)   | Unoptimized (ms) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
|100        |16.7              |32.6              |
|200        |21.7              |46.2              |
|300        |26.6              |58.2              |
|400        |31.5              |78.2              |
|500        |35.3              |85.7              |
|1000       |61.1              |165               |
|1250       |74.1              |198.7             |
|1500       |85.1              |231.8             |
|1750       |94.6              |258.7             |
|2000       |106               |303.7             |

![scaling of clicking all checkbox using unoptimized app](../images/select-all-checkbox-scaling.png)

## Avoid Algorithms Inside UI

Front-loading algorithms in `applyState`, which always recomputes, may seem like an unnecessary use of client resources. If individual subtrees of `state` were passed into the component and then computed inside, useless computations would be circumvented. For example, if the algorithm in `getFilteredRows` existed inside `TableRows`, strict equality would be met more often (as opposed to never met).

```jsx
const TableRows = (props) => {
    const { filters, focusedFilter, searchText, rows, rowIds } = props
    const currentFilter = filters.find(({ id }) => id === focusedFilter);

    const filteredRowIds = rowIds.filter((rowId) =>
        currentFilter?.conditions.every(
            (cond) => rows[rowId][cond.key] === cond.value
        ) ?? true
    )
        .filter((rowId) => rows[rowId].name.includes(searchText));

    return (
        <>
            {filteredRowIds.map((id) => {
                return <TableRow id={id} key={id} />;
            })}
        </>
    );
};

const mappedState = () => (state) => {
    const { filters, focusedFilter, searchText, rowIds, rows } = state
    return { filters, focusedFilter, searchText, rowIds, rows }
};

export default applyState(mappedState)(TableRows);
```

This true, but impractical. Maintainability comes first for enterprise software. Algorithms in UI violate separation of concerns and are not reusable. On top of that, there is already a solution for this. Functional (pure) memoization strategies enable patterns that are robust, extremely effective (when used correctly), and reusable. There is no denying that memoization has performance penalties. But the impact is normally small and provides massive increases in scalability. It is almost always worth it.

## To be continued

With these concepts, typical web apps gain huge performance wins. But this is only scratching the surface of the knowledge for fully optimized React apps. To get the full picture, these topics need to be covered.

- Structuring normalized state trees
- Robust memoization strategies for computed data
- Dispatching optimal state transformations
