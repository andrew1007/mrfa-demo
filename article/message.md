## Andrew things to improve
- Stop asking leading questions (trying to constantly indirectly persuade people, via questions).
- More acts of service.
- More direct communication. Immediately start with the intent/agenda of the conversations and then build on top of that.
- Shouldn't criticize cultures in front of that group of people
- Be punctual about our commitments.
- Be more emotionally attentive when the other person is having interpersonal issues.
- Stop overexplaining (this is going to take *a really long time* to fix)

## Core issues
- I suppress your voice/opinion in the conversation, because I am always in full control over it (stop persuading via questions).
- I insult your intelligence by talking down to you (stop over-explaining).
- You don't feel cared for in the way you desire (more acts of service).
- You don't feel emotionally supported (be more emotionally attentive when you talk about problems).
- I belittled your identity (don't criticize other cultures).
- Respect my/our time (be more punctual).

## My Ask
When asking for a behavior change, we need to make sure we both understand how the change will resolve the core issue. When it is obvious that the behavior change will solve a particular solution, it doesn't even need to be openly discussed.

If you cannot describe what problem the behavior change solves and I don't understand why you're asking for me to change, that means:

1. The core issue's solution is not your requested behavior change.
2. You don't know what the core issue is.

The real issue is when there is a behavior change request and it is *not* the solution to the core issue. Your request was "Don't play video games for too long" and "stop oversleeping", but what your real request was "Don't play to the point of sleep deprivation and *cannot meet our scheduled commitments*."

True issue is that I am not punctual. True reason is because I do not allocate my time properly, in general. It has nothing to do with video games. In the past, I have had the same problem with studying and programming. If you asked me to be more punctual I would not have said anything against that and agreed immediately. After that, it is my responsibility to figure out how to accomplish that.

When you have a solid understanding of the core issue, your ask is either

1. Talking about the core issue.
2. Asking for a behavior change that matches the concept/theme of the core issue.

When your understanding of the core issue is abstract, you ask for a behavior change that is highly speculative. It is your "best guess".

A good request is "show more care/be supportive of me". A bad request would be "Say that I'm right when I tell you about a fight I had with my friend".
