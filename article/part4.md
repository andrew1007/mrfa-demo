# Make React Fast Again Part 4: Full Scale Application Analysis

## Introduction

When designed correctly, UI applications can be fast, [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), and scale to any level of complexity.

This is the last step, where I prove that this works as well as I say it does. That it scales in situations where conventional approaches crumple like paper.

A sample application that can be dynamically scaled in complexity will be benchmarked and its various architectural properties will be analyzed to help understand this approach's practicality and effectiveness.


## Conclusion

UI software design with a completely new lens. With everything said and done, I hope you see things the way I do now.
