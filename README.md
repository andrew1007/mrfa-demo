# Make React Fast Again Demo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A web app with two implementations of the same feature: a searchable, filterable, and selectable table.

The `Optimized` table uses the design patterns to suppress useless rerenders.

The `Local state` table uses local state and a god component.
